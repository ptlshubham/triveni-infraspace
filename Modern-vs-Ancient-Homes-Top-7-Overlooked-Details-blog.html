                                            architecture that makes its own statement and has a clean design. But they
                                            are not just the result of going back and fixing up an old way of building.
                                            Modern houses are the result of careful planning, design, and construction.
                                            They also reflect their owners' personalities in a sensible way.</p>
                                        <p>So, what are the biggest differences between houses built in the past and
                                            houses built today? How does using methods like Vastu Shastra affect the way
                                            smart homes are built? Let's try to find answers to these questions today!
                                        </p>

                                        <h5>1. Easy is better than hard</h5>
                                        <p>Ancient architecture from the 19th and 20th centuries was based on elegant
                                            and spacious designs. Modern houses, on the other hand, are built to be as
                                            useful as possible while keeping costs down. This principle is true even for
                                            the smallest parts of how it is done.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Also, I want to talk about the size and layout. In traditional, old
                                            architecture, many single units are put together to make a huge building.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>People say that old architecture likes to cover up its features with too many
                                            details and decorations. On the other hand, modern architecture focuses on
                                            making a structure that shows off its sharp edges. "Simplicity is the
                                            ultimate sophistication," said Da Vinci.</p>
                                        <h5>2. Changes in the way it's done</h5>
                                        <p>Ancient buildings had beautiful handwork that was done by local craftsmen.
                                            Modern architecture, on the other hand, depends on skill and style.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            As building technology improved quickly, modern architecture and building
                                            started to use basic principles like good planning, scheduling, and
                                            management.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This has helped a lot with optimising the project, checking the quality of
                                            the materials, and making sure the design is right, which has led to a
                                            well-built building form.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>
                                            3. Differences in elements
                                        </h5>
                                        <p>From the furniture to the curtains, there are many noticeable differences
                                            between modern and old homes. Modern homes have to pay a lot of attention to
                                            storage.</p>
                                        <p>Traditional homes put a lot of emphasis on ornamental pieces, elaborate
                                            interiors, and artwork, but modern homes care more about simple designs that
                                            make the most money.</p>
                                        <p>Take the example of small kitchen counters in modern homes that are both
                                            stylish and have more space for storage. And floors that are lighter in
                                            colour to let in more light, which brightens the space and makes it look
                                            bigger.</p>
                                        <h5>
                                            4. The shape and figure
                                        </h5>
                                        <p>Lack of land is a big problem in the modern world. Back then, there was
                                            plenty of space for buildings to grow. Now, vertical construction is growing
                                            faster than horizontal construction. And building methods like MIVAN, RCC,
                                            and even 3D printing have a big impact on the shapes.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Modern architecture is more willing to try new things and break away from
                                            what has always been done.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Investing is a key part of any field, and architecture is no different. Rapid
                                            changes in the modern world have given people more choices. Back then, only
                                            big buildings were built with a lot of money. Now, things are changing, and
                                            even commercial buildings around the world are getting more work and money.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>5. Material alternatives</h5>
                                        <p>In ancient architecture, there weren't many materials to choose from, but
                                            today there are a lot! For example, ancient Terra Cota Bricks have been
                                            easily replaced by concrete blocks, and plastering has been made easier by
                                            using gypsum boards.</p>
                                        <p>Not only have the materials changed a lot, but so has the way they are put
                                            together. For example, traditional rammed earth has been replaced by
                                            hydraulically compacted rammed earth, which is much more efficient.</p>

                                        <p>Also, in the new age, the industry has become very specific, and
                                            professionals know exactly what they need instead of making do with the few
                                            options they have. Alvar Aalto, a famous Finnish architect, said, "Modern
                                            architecture does not mean using immature new materials; the main thing is
                                            to refine materials in a more human direction."</p>
                                        <h5>6. Changing the way convenience works</h5>
                                        <p>Unlike old homes, smart homes of today use technology to make things better
                                            and make sure convenience is at its best.</p>
                                        <p>Home automation has changed the way things are done by giving people the
                                            power to control things like light and temperature through the internet.</p>
                                        <p>A smart home that is automated can also have features like control over the
                                            air quality, voice control, and better security.</p>
                                        <h5>7. The vastu shastra system</h5>
                                        <p>Vastu Shastra is an old, traditional system that covers all aspects of
                                            building design, including space geometry, arrangement, orientation, layout,
                                            measurement, and scaling</p>
                                        <p>Back then, projects were done by following the rules of this system verbally.
                                            Now, Vastu Shastra as a whole is studied as a course and is religiously used
                                            in architecture.</p>
                                        <p>Modern architecture is designed and built based on the basic rules of Vastu,
                                            such as where different parts and rooms are put in a building.</p>
                                        <p>Even though ancient architecture and modern architecture have very different
                                            ideas about beauty and how to design, they do have some things in common.
                                            Say, in the case of bringing harmony to proportions and scale co-ordinations
                                            in architecture. When we look at both times, the materials that were
                                            available also affected how things looked.</p>
                                        <p>Modern architecture has a lot of uses and can work in many different areas,
                                            such as multi-utilitarian designs, modern energy, designs that save money,
                                            and architecture that is friendly to the environment and cares about it.</p>
                                        <p>Also, some parts of ancient architecture have been taken out of modern
                                            architecture on purpose because they no longer serve a purpose. Still, many
                                            changes have been made to architecture in recent years to meet the needs of
                                            the time. One example is a building that can be used for both business and
                                            housing.</p>
